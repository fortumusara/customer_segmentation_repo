# 🧠 Customer Segmentation & Personalization ETL Pipeline

This project demonstrates a real-time ETL pipeline for customer segmentation and 
personalized offer delivery. It integrates data from banking transactions, customer 
demographics, and engagement sources to build enriched customer profiles and drive marketing decisions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Goal:** Segment customers based on behavior and demographics, and deliver real-time personalized 
offers using modern data tools and ML algorithms.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Kafka** – Real-time transaction ingestion
- **PySpark** – Transformation and clustering (K-Means)
- **Snowflake** – Centralized data warehouse
- **AWS Glue** – ETL orchestration
- **Python APIs** – Integration with personalization platforms (e.g., Salesforce, Twilio)

Pipeline Architecture

▶️ Quickstart
✅ Start Kafka Producer

    cd kafka_producer
    python send_transactions.py

✅ Launch Spark Streaming Job

    cd spark_processing
    spark-submit stream_processor.py

✅ Load Segments to Snowflake

    cd snowflake_loader
    python load_to_snowflake.py

📊 Sample Use Case

    A customer in the Gold Tier with high grocery spending and low travel purchases might receive:

    "Earn 30% cash back on groceries this month, and 20% off your next travel booking!"

🔮 Roadmap

Terraform Template for AWS Glue, Snowflake, Kafka

Databricks Notebook for clustering & LTV scoring

REST API mock for customer demographics

Dashboard with Power BI or Streamlit
